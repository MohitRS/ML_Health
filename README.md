## Assignment Details:
This repository contains the code, datasets, and outputs for the "Profound Hypotension Analysis - ICU Patients" - assignment 2. The primary objective of this project is to analyze the clinical data of ICU patients experiencing profound hypotension and derive insights regarding patient outcomes, demographics, and associated comorbidities.

## Problem Description:
Profound hypotension can be a critical condition for patients in the ICU. This project aims to:

1. Provide a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the given cohort.
2. Implement and evaluate K-Means to predict outcomes.
3. Visualize and interpret the results to provide actionable clinical insights.

Understanding these patterns can aid in better patient management, tailored intervention strategies, and potentially improved patient outcomes.

## Setting Up the Environment:
To ensure smooth execution of the code, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohitRS/ML_Health/
   cd assignments
   ```
2. **Use/Install packages mentioned in requirements.txt**
   Note:
   The assignment was done on Google Colab, with command !pip install lifelines as an additional library install
   The rest of the libraries were already available in colab by default.
3. **Use Right Dataset Name**
   In this git there is a csv file containing the hypotension patient information. Please ensure to use the right name in case you run your own file or on a local system.
